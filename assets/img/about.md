I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student under the guidance of Dr.Keke Chen, specializing in areas such as differential privacy, confidential computation, machine unlearning, and more. Anticipating graduation in December 2024, I am actively seeking job opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you have any relevant opportunities or inquiries.
