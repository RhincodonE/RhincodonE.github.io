I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kekechen/home?authuser=0">Dr.Keke Chen</a> in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kekechen/researchtaic-lab?authuser=0">Trustworthy and Intelligent Computing Lab (TAIC)</a>. I'm interested in areas such as *differential privacy*, *confidential computation*, *machine unlearning*, and more. Anticipating graduation in December 2024, I am actively seeking job opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you have any relevant opportunities or inquiries.
